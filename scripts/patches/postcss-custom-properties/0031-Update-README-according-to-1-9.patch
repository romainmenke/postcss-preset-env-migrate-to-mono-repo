+**N.B.** The transformation _is not complete_. It currently just aims to provide a future-proof way of using a **limited subset (to `:root` selector)** of the features provided by native CSS custom properties. Read [#1](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties/issues/1) & [#9](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties/issues/9) to know why this limitation exists.
 
 Works great with [postcss-calc](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-calc).
