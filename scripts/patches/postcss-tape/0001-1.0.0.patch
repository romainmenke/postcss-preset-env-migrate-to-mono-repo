+# CC0 1.0 Universal
+
+## Statement of Purpose
+
+The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
+exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
+subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
+authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
+
+Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
+purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
+(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
+infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
+redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
+including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
+to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
+production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
+greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
+others.
+
+For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
+additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
+Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
+and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
+publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
+effect of CC0 on those rights.
+
+1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
+	 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
+	 Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
+	 to, the following:
+	1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
+		 communicate, and translate a Work;
+	2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
+	3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
+		 depicted in a Work;
+	4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
+		 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
+	5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
+		 in a Work;
+	6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
+		 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
+		 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
+		 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
+	7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
+		 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
+		 thereof.
+
+2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
+applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
+unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
+and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
+known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
+action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
+duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
+extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
+copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
+commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer makes
+the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
+detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
+shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
+any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
+by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
+
+3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
+judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
+shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
+Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
+is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
+transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
+license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
+all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
+law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
+future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
+whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
+purposes (the “License”). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date
+CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
+reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
+partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
+License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
+exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
+or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
+Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
+
+4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
+		1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
+			 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
+		2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
+			 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
+			 or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
+			 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
+			 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
+			 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
+			 extent permissible under applicable law.
+		3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
+			 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
+			 limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
+			 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
+			 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
+		4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
+			 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
+			 this CC0 or use of the Work.

+# PostCSS Tape
+
+Quickly test a PostCSS plugin.
+
+1. Install this dependency to your project:
+
+   ```sh
+   npm install jonathantneal/postcss-tape
+   ```
+
+2. Add the `postcss-tape` task to your `package.json`:
+
+   ```json
+   {
+      "scripts": {
+        "tape": "postcss-tape"
+      }
+   }
+   ```
+
+3. Add tests to your `.tape.js` file:
+
+   ```js
+   module.exports = {
+		'postcss-my-plugin': {
+			'basic': {
+				message: 'supports basic usage'
+			}
+		}
+   };
+   ```
+
+That’s it! Now you can use the `tape` task:
+
+```sh
+npm run tape
+```
+
+### Options
+
+Options may be passed through `package.json` using `postcssConfig`:
+
+```json
+{
+	"postcssConfig": {
+		"plugin": "path/to/plugin.js",
+		"config": "path/to/.tape.js",
+		"fixtures": "path/to/cssdir"
+	}
+}
+```
+
+Options may be passed through arguments:
+
+```sh
+postcss-tape --plugin=path/to/plugin.js --config=path/to/.tape.js
+```
