+# CC0 1.0 Universal
+
+## Statement of Purpose
+
+The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
+exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
+subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
+authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
+
+Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
+purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
+(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
+infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
+redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
+including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
+to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
+production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
+greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
+others.
+
+For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
+additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
+Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
+and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
+publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
+effect of CC0 on those rights.
+
+1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
+   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
+   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
+   to, the following:
+   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
+      and translate a Work;
+   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
+   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
+      depicted in a Work;
+   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
+      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
+   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
+      a Work;
+   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
+      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
+      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
+      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
+   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
+      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
+      thereof.
+
+2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
+   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
+   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
+   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
+   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
+   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
+   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
+   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
+   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
+   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
+   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
+   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
+   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
+   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
+   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
+   Statement of Purpose.
+
+3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
+   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
+   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
+   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
+   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
+   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
+   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
+   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
+   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
+   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
+   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
+   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
+   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
+   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
+   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
+   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
+   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
+   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
+   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
+   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
+
+4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
+   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
+      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
+   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
+      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
+      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
+      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
+      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
+      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
+      extent permissible under applicable law.
+   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
+      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
+      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
+      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
+      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
+   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
+      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
+      CC0 or use of the Work.

+# PostCSS Focus Within [<img src="https://postcss.github.io/postcss/logo.svg" alt="PostCSS Logo" width="90" height="90" align="right">][postcss]
+
+[![NPM Version][npm-img]][npm-url]
+[![Build Status][cli-img]][cli-url]
+[![Windows Build Status][win-img]][win-url]
+[![Gitter Chat][git-img]][git-url]
+
+[PostCSS Focus Within] lets you use the `:focus-within` pseudo-selector in
+CSS, following the [Selectors Level 4 specification].
+
+```css
+.my-form-field:focus-within label {
+  background-color: yellow;
+}
+
+/* becomes */
+
+.my-form-field[focus-within] label {
+  background-color: yellow;
+}
+```
+
+[PostCSS Focus Within] replaces the `:focus-within` pseudo-selector with a
+`.focus-within` class selector, the same selector used by the
+[focus-within polyfill]. The replacement selector can be changed using the
+`replaceWith` option.
+
