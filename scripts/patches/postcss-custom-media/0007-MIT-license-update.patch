Subject: [PATCH 07/62] MIT license update
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

According to what I understand from the MIT license, the name of the
original author in the copyright seems to be the only obligation to
respect it correctly.

Iâ€™m also possibly waiting for a response here
